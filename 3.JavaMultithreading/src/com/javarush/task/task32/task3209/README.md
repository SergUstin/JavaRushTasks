# HTML Editor

In this project I learned:
- Create applications with a graphical interface.
- Work with dialog boxes.
- Use classes from the Swing library.
- Implement the interaction of program components using events, listeners, actions.
- Strengthened my knowledge in the field of MVC.

What can be improved in the developed editor:
- Add a toolbar that repeats the functionality of the menu.
- Add html tag highlighting on the second tab.
- Add the ability to download a document from the Internet.
- Expand the editor's capabilities (inserting images, links, etc.)
