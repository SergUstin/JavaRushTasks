# Chat

The result of the project:
• Wrote a server for text messaging.<br>
• Wrote a console client that can connect to the server and exchange messages with other participants.<br>
• Wrote a client bot that can accept requests and send data about the current date and time.<br>
• Wrote a client for a chat with a graphical interface.

What I learned:
• Work with sockets.<br>
• Use serialization and deserialization.<br>
• Create multithreaded applications, synchronize them, apply the volatile modifier, use classes from the java.util.concurrent library.<br>
• Apply the MVC pattern.<br>
• Use internal and nested classes.<br>
• Work with the Swing library.<br>
• Apply Calendar and SimpleDateFormat classes.<br>
